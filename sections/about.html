       Hello! I am Aswathy Ajaykumar, a recent Software Engineering graduate from the University of Southampton with a passion for building full-stack applications, developing secure solutions, and applying formal methods to real-world systems.
      </p>

      <p>
        During my degree, I led several impactful projects, from creating an educational game that teaches matching algorithms, to designing a safety-critical system for managing railway level crossings.
      </p>

      <p>
        I am especially driven by the idea of using technology to solve real-world challenges, whether thatâ€™s designing for inclusion, improving transport safety, or simplifying complex systems through thoughtful automation and design.
      </p>

      <p>
        Beyond code, you will usually find me in the kitchen experimenting with new recipes, and yes, tiramisu is my signature dish! ðŸ˜‰
