    <div class="about-container">
      <p>
        Hi! I'm <strong>Aswathy Ajaykumar</strong>, a passionate and detail-oriented software engineer with a background in building full-stack applications, developing secure IoT solutions, and applying formal methods to real-world systems like railway signalling and healthcare tools.
      </p>

      <p>
        I recently completed my degree in Software Engineering at the University of Southampton, where I led various projects — from an accessibility-focused game teaching matching algorithms, to implementing railway level crossing safety systems using Event-B and ProB.
      </p>

      <p>
        I'm especially interested in using technology to solve real-world problems — whether it's designing for inclusion, improving transport safety, or simplifying complex systems through automation and thoughtful design.
      </p>

      <p>
        Beyond code, I'm a food content creator on Instagram, a former GDG campus organiser, and someone who’s always up for a challenge (especially if it involves research, travel, or TikTok trends 😉).
